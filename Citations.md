In order to finish our piano we needed to figure out how to use the various peripherals that we had declared in our project proposal. For the audio interaction, the main source that we found helpful was John Loomis and his numerous labs on implementing different peripherals. To establish the connection with the keyboard we again used John Loomis' module as well as the University of Toronto. When it came to generating specific notes, a former student project's module was used. The completion of this project would not have been possible without the help of the following sources.
